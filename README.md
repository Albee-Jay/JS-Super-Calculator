# JS-Super-Calculator
This is a JavaScript Super-Calculator.

I built this project while studying on my own from a book about learning JavaScript. I think it turned out pretty good, I'm happy with it.

See it live here: https://albee-jay.github.io/JS-Super-Calculator/

This is a simple looking project but nearly half the code is JavaScript with HTML and CSS making up the rest.

I welcome and appreciate any and all comments or help to make this project better.

Thank You, Albee-Jay
